# Debugging Derbies

Debugged on VSCode.
Basiccaly this task was easy. There were a bunch of syntax errors like missing ";" that just required very basic programming knowledge, also there were errors in logic in some equations like when just a single wrong answer is inputted, the count of wrong answer became 23 and "/" was used instead of "*" and some operations were swapped. I got the program running and did a lot of testing to check if output is given in each case. Though, not everything is perfect right? So, there might be some bugs left, sorry for that.
