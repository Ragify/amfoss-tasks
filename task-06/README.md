# Geddit

Sorry, I was not able to do this.
The only thing that I use Reddit is for looking at memes :). I have not even heard about "GoLang" before this tasks. I wanted to attempt this task because I was offended knowing that something like this existed because there is not a single day that I don't look at memes, but I kept this for the last and ended up not doing this.
