Actually I had Ubuntu installed before and after I saw the tasks I wanted to checkout some other Distro, so I installed Linux Mint 20.
I started with downloading the ISO from <a href="https://www.linuxmint.com/download.php">[here]</a>.
Then took an USB, created a bootable USB with Rufus<a href="https://rufus.ie">[link]</a>.
Next I turned off my laptop and booted into the bootable USB and installed it.
Thats it!! :)
