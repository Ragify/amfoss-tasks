# Circuit Design

Sorry, I was not able to do this. I had some work in school on Arduino to make a Buzzer for a quiz fest but I mainly worked on soldering and other hardware related works, but I never did any programming with Arduino. So I did not even try this, though I watched some basic videos about Arduino on YouTube.
