# Ubiquitous UI

Sorry, I was not able to do this. I did not have any idea about Flutter or Dart, though I have Android Studio already installed because I am avid an Android user and I got into the crazy world of Android customisation and have done a lot like installing custom ROMS, custom Kernals, tweaking, I even ended up hard bricking one of my devices, so I always tried first in Android emulator that comes with Android Studio before proceeding to install it on my device. And about the task, first of all I watched some YouTube videos and thought that this task would be easy but then I came to know that we are supposed to make an UI that looked exactly the same as the one given in the sample, so kept this task in my To-Do list as I got interested in this. But hard luck, I could not do it :(.
