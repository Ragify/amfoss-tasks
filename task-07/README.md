# Ubiquitous UI

Sorry, I was not able to do this. First of all I watched some YouTube videos and thought that this task would be easy but then I came to know that we are supposed to make an UI that looked exactly the same as the one given in the sample, so kept this task in my To-Do list as I got interested in this. But hard luck, I could not do it :(.
