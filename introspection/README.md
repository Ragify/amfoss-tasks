# Introspection

### 1.Why must we choose you?
First of all, I am very passionate about Technology and everything related to it, also I am an extrovert, social person and likes to work as a team. I like programming and know basics of C++ and a little bit of Python. I am also an avid gamer. Watching Tech on YouTube, browsing XDA developer and GitHub, and installing custom ROMs, kernel, etc. are my daily hobbies. Since amFOSS is renowned for it's diversity I think it's a great place for me to learn and improve my knowledge. Getting to know so much people with similar interest will obviously encourage me. I really pray and wish to be a part of the best club!! 

### 2.What is your plan for the next 6 months? 
I am going to focus on my first semester and try to get good CGPA. Also I would like to experiment with amFOSS and hope the pandemic gets over so everyone can come to the College.

### 3.How would you contribute back to the club?
With the best of my knowledge and abilities, I will contribute anything necessary for the club. Also I would love to work in teams, as I said earlier that I am a team player.

### 4.Do you have any feedback for the selection process?
The registration was really easy and the senior members are so friendly and are very helpful. The problem I faced was with the tasks, while most of them were easy to moderate, some just blew up my head even though I studied Computer Science in my school. I feel the level of tasks should be moderated so that people who are interested can join the club so that whether they have prior experience or not or what they studied or did not may not be a factor for them to lose a chance to join. Apart from this, everything else so far is great!!:)
