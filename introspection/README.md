# Introspection

### 1.Why must we choose you?
First of all, I am very passionate about Technology and everything related to it, also I am an extrovert,social person and likes to work as a team. I like programming and know basics of C++ and a little bit of Python. I am also an avid gamer. Watching Tech on YouTube, browsing XDA developer and GitHub, and installing custom ROMs, kernel, etc. are my daily hobbies. Since amFOSS is renowned for it's diversity I think it's a great place for me to learn and improve my knowledge. Getting to know so much people with similar interest will obviously encourage me. I really pray and wish to be a part of the best club!!
